# Transposition, a bio-inspired operator

Evolutionary Computation's project. The course was delivered by the University of Coimbra in the academic year 2020-21 and helded by prof. [Ernesto Costa](https://ernesto.dei.uc.pt/)

## Description

We study in the landscape of evolutionary algorithm a bio-inspired variation operator, the transposition, and we compare it with the uniform crossover operator. We use the Rastrigin and the Schwafel function and we run the algorithm for 30 times, in order to assure a valid statistical meaning. We graphically compare the best overall values and the generation average of the bests values. We perform statistical test with the best at the end values, to understand if there are significance difference between the methods.
